ID,VALUE,CVE,DESCRIPTION
EXP_1,config/getuser?index=0,CVE-2020-25078,An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-2530L before 1.06.01 Hotfix and DCS-2670L through 2.02 devices. The unauthenticated /config/getuser endpoint allows for remote administrator password disclosure.
EXP_2,login.cgi,CVE-2017-9100,login.cgi on D-Link DIR-600M devices with firmware 3.04 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by entering more than 20 blank spaces in the password field during an admin login attempt.
EXP_3,struts2-rest-showcase,CVE-2017-9805,The REST Plugin in Apache Struts 2.1.1 through 2.3.x before 2.3.34 and 2.5.x before 2.5.13 uses an XStreamHandler with an instance of XStream for deserialization without any type filtering which can lead to Remote Code Execution when deserializing XML payloads.
EXP_4,cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh,CVE-2021-41773, A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied" these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete.

EXP_6,ftptest.cgi,CVE-2017-8225,On Wireless IP Camera (P2P) WIFICAM devices access to .ini files (containing credentials) is not correctly checked. An attacker can bypass authentication by providing an empty loginuse parameter and an empty loginpas parameter in the URI.
EXP_7,ftptest.cgi?loginuse=&loginpas=,CVE-2017-8225,On Wireless IP Camera (P2P) WIFICAM devices access to .ini files (containing credentials) is not correctly checked. An attacker can bypass authentication by providing an empty loginuse parameter and an empty loginpas parameter in the URI.
EXP_8,set_ftp.cgi?,CVE-2017-8225,On Wireless IP Camera (P2P) WIFICAM devices access to .ini files (containing credentials) is not correctly checked. An attacker can bypass authentication by providing an empty loginuse parameter and an empty loginpas parameter in the URI.
EXP_9,ping.cgi,CVE-2020-10173,Comtrend VR-3033 DE11-416SSG-C01_R02.A2pvI042j1.d26m devices have Multiple Authenticated Command Injection vulnerabilities via the ping and traceroute diagnostic pages as demonstrated by shell metacharacters in the pingIpAddress parameter to ping.cgi.
